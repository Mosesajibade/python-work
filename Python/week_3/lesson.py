# Problem 1:
# Write a function called multiplier. it should accept two arguments. The first arg, "l", should be
# a list of numbers. The second arg, "m", should be a number. In the function, iterate through
# the list of numbers and multiply them by the multiplier. First, print out the list that was
# passed as an argument. Once the loop is complete and the numbers have been multiplied, print out
# the new list. Call this function for both the first and second sets of multipliers and lists.

M = 3
L = [15, 12, 22, 8, 4]

multiplier_two = 4
num_data_two = [5, 88, 64, 35]


def multiplier(L, M):
    print(L)     # always print first to test it out
    out = []      #the results will go in this function
    

multiplier(L,M)


# def multiplier(I, m):
